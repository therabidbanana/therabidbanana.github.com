Hi there - my name is David and I'm looking for work. I've worked at a few
places and built some cool stuff, let me tell you a bit about myself and what
I've done.

## Skills/Interests

I'm a Rubyist at heart, but I have a pretty wide range. I have had experience
developing with JS/CoffeeScript and Backbone.js, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra,
Padrino and PHP. For fun, I've also dabbled a bit with Objective-C and node.js.

I'm obsessed with constantly improving my code techniques - some of my major
influences recently have been Uncle Bob's talk on the [Lost Years of
Architecture](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years),
Matt Wynne's talk on [Hexagonal Rails](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/977),
and Steve Klabnik's talks/writing about [Hypermedia
APIs](http://designinghypermediaapis.com/). I'm always on the look out for
new ways to improve my code, keeping it clean and flexible to change.

## Work Experience

### **Lead Developer/CTO** at [Reachably](https://www.reachably.com/) (2011-2012)

At Reachably, I've been the lead developer of our site's HAL+JSON API built
with Sinatra and authenticated with OAuth 2. I've also been a major contributer
to our frontend Rails and Backbone.js code.

* Reachably API: <https://api.reachably.com/>

  The reachably API is a Hypermedia API using the HAL+JSON mimetype that runs
  on the Padrino framework. We built a fork of the
  [Hal Browser](http://explorer.dtime.com/explorer#GET:https://api.reachably.com/activity/short/all)
  to make it easier to browse. Our website consumes our API using the same
  API calls we intend to make available to the public, as well as our mobile
  app.

* Reachably Website: <https://www.reachably.com/>

  The Reachably website consumes our API with a gem we wrote for it (based on
  Faraday). You can read more about that in my previous blog post entry:
  [Dogfooding Our Api](http://www.davidhaslem.com/blog/2012/dogfooding-our-api/).
  The site also has a Backbone.js application that I lead the development on,
  consuming our API directly without talking through the Rails app.

Some of the open source stuff I worked on while working at Reachably:

* tilt-jade gem: <https://github.com/therabidbanana/tilt-jade>

  A gem for the asset pipeline to compile .jade templates
  (<http://jade-lang.com/>) into JST templates so that they can be used for
  client-side rendering in Rails.

* jquery-mentions-input: <https://github.com/dtime/jquery-mentions-input>

  A fork of an existing project to add new functionality for Reachably,
  as well as bugfixes.


### **Web Developer** at [Orange Sparkle Ball](http://www.orangesparkleball.com/) (2008-2011)

Some of the open source stuff I worked on while working at Orange Sparkle Ball:

* eventbrite gem: <https://github.com/therabidbanana/eventbrite>

  A gem for interfacing with the Eventbrite API. Not actively maintained any
  more, as the company has an official gem.

* orange framework: <https://github.com/orange-project>

  The goal was to build a Ruby-based CMS that was as simple as possible for us
  to build with and gave our clients a simple interface. No longer maintained,
  but a fun experiment for learning exactly what's involved in building a
  framework.

* Baker Framework: <https://github.com/Simbul/baker>

  Not my project, but I contributed some code fixes and feature enhancements
  to the Baker Framework while using it for a project at Orange Sparkle Ball.
  Notable mainly because this was my first experience using Objective C.

### **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu)

During college, I assisted with two research projects to help build better
routers. I ended up being listed as a coauthor on two papers about them:
