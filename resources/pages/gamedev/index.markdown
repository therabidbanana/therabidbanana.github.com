# Game Development

I have made a hobby of making games with my daughters. We started with a Scratch for Beginners book and I've begun exploring alternatives.

## Projects

### Disastrous Flying Critters

Help the Rainbow Witch Princess save the kingdom from the Disastrous Flying Critters trying to destroy it! Fly around the kingdoms, close the portals with your color changing magic, and restore the terrain to the correct hue.

[Play it on Itch.io](https://therabidbanana.itch.io/disastrous-flying-critters)

### Asteroids

Space Flyer - a game made in scratch. Initial build from Scratch for Beginners, additional recommendations made by Fiona and Ada.
