_See also - my list of [Game Dev Resources](/gamedev/resources/)_

I have made a hobby of making games with my daughters. We started with a Scratch for Beginners book and I've begun exploring alternatives to keep them engaged while also trying to level up my own skill set.

## Projects


### Disastrous Flying Critters
