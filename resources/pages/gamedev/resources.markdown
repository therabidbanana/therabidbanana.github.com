# Game Dev Resources

This is a list of links to Game development resources I've gathered.

## Other Frameworks

* Dragon Ruby - a framework for building games with Ruby, haven't had a chance to try it yet - <https://dragonruby.itch.io/>
* <https://love2d.org/> - Interested to try it with fennel - <https://sr.ht/~benthor/absolutely-minimal-love2d-fennel/>

## Tic80

Tic80 is a fantasy console for making tiny games. It is open source, comes with tools for drawing 16 color sprites and making music, and can be programmed in several other languages including Lua, Fennel, and Ruby.

## Scratch

Scratch is a block based programming environment geared toward teaching kids how to code.

* Main website

  <https://scratch.mit.edu/>
  
* _Coding for Beginners_ is a friendly intro to Scratch - I have an old edition so I've ended up needing to translate some of the blocks.
