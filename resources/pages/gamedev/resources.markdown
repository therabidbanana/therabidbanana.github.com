This is a list of links to Game development resources I've gathered.

## Other Frameworks

* Dragon Ruby - a framework for building games with Ruby, haven't had a chance to try it yet - <https://dragonruby.itch.io/>
* <https://love2d.org/> - Interested to try it with fennel - <https://sr.ht/~benthor/absolutely-minimal-love2d-fennel/>

## Tic80

Tic80 is a fantasy console for making tiny games. It is open source, comes with tools for drawing 16 color sprites and making music, and can be programmed in several other languages including Lua, Fennel, and Ruby.

## Scratch

Scratch is a block based programming environment geared toward teaching kids how to code.

* Main website

  <https://scratch.mit.edu/>
  
* _Coding for Beginners_ is a friendly intro to Scratch - I have an old edition so I've ended up needing to translate some of the blocks.

  [Coding for Beginners on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Beginners-Scratch-Rosie-Dickins/dp/1474975097)
  
* Leopard JS - convert Scratch .sb3 to web format, more focused on readable/hackable code generation: <https://leopardjs.com/>
* TurboWarp Packager - convert Scratch .sb3 to web, with emphasis on performance and completeness - html is difficult to hack afterward, but experience is closer to what you see in Scratch: <https://packager.turbowarp.org/>

## Lua
