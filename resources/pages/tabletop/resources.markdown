title: Tabletop Resources
---

This is a list of links to resources to make tabletop games I've gathered. My Tenkiwi platform is Clojure/Clojurescript, so also check out [Engineering Resources](/engineering/resources/)

## SRDs

* Lots of different rules systems (System Reference Documents - SRDs) to start from: <https://fari.community/>

## Layout

* Affinity Publisher is a great alternative to Adobe InDesign subscription - one time purchase and lots of resources to get started with: <https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/>

### Fonts

* Google Fonts - <https://fonts.google.com/>

### Free Images

Images to do layout can be useful - be careful to check licensing conditions, but most of these offer public domain or creative commons images with commerical support:
