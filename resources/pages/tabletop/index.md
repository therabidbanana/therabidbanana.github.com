I play a lot of tabletop games when I'm not at a computer. I've even tried to build some of my own, mixing together my software skills with one of my favorite hobbies to try and build roleplaying games that drive themselves.

## Projects

### Tenkiwi

My biggest game project so far is Tenkiwi, an open source platform I built for playing storytelling games. Imagine it as a platform for building Jackbox games with Dungeons and Dragons.

[^Tenkiwi]

Tenkiwi supports two game modes out of the box, and I've built 4 other game modes released as expansions you can get on Itch. You can learn more about it on the [itch page](https://therabidbanana.itch.io/tenkiwi). It's build with Clojure and Clojurescript (+ Expo for native apps) and the server component is hosted in Heroku.

### Charge Party Extra

I really like Charge as a generic RPG system. I wrote a "Charge Extra" to simulate some of the mechanics from Forged in the Dark games that have crew mechanics.

## Playing

_See also - my list of [Gaming Resources](/tabletop/play-resources/)_

Our family tries to play board games and RPGs at least once a month - here are some of the games we've enjoyed.

### With the Kiddos

* My Little Scythe - this is a great interpretation of the Scythe rules geared toward kids.
* No Thank You, Evil! - a great starter RPG
* Charge RPG - great bones for playing custom one-shots the kids request on RPG day

### Grownup Games

* Scythe
* Dune Imperium
* Game of Thrones LCG
* Lord of the Rings LCG
* Arkham Horror (2nd and 3rd edition)
