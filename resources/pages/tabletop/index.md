# Tabletop Games

_See also - my list of [Tabletop Dev Resources](/tabletop/resources/)_

I play a lot of tabletop games when I'm not at a computer. I've even tried to build some of my own, mixing together my software skills with one of my favorite hobbies to try and build roleplaying games that drive themselves.


## Projects

My biggest game project so far is Tenkiwi, an open source platform I built for playing storytelling games. Imagine it as a platform for building Jackbox games with Dungeons and Dragons.

^[You can try out Tenkiwi online here, but it's not any fun with one player: <https://play.tenkiwi.com/>]

Tenkiwi supports two game modes out of the box, and I've built 4 other game modes released as expansions you can get on Itch. You can learn more about it on the [itch page](https://therabidbanana.itch.io/tenkiwi). It's build with Clojure and Clojurescript and the server component is hosted in Heroku.

## Playing

Our family tries to play board games and RPGs at least once a month - it's not as much as we'd like but gotta also have time to play video games.

### With the Kiddos

* My Little Scythe - this is a great interpretation of the Scythe rules geared toward kids.
* No Thank You, Evil! - a great starter RPG
* Charge RPG - great bones for playing custom one-shots the kids request on RPG day
